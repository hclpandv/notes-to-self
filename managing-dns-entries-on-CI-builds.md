#### Managing DNS entries on CI builds

**Problem Statement**

> Continuous integration process creates intermediate build(s) against each branch and if we need to test a certain branch a seperate URL is needed for better management as compared to hosting branches with different IP address or port number.

**Constraints**

* Bitbucket to be used as git repo
* Amazon EC2 Intances to be used as servers for DNS and Developement webserver.
* Developement server will host the branch specific web application.

**Solution**

* hhhh
